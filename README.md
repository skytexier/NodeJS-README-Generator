# Node README Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
          
# Description
  
This NodeJS README Generator takes user inputs from a terminal and populates a markdown based upon user inputs/selections. The motivation behind creating this project was to better understand the implementation of Node packages like Inquierer, and to better understand how JavaScript works with Node. This README Generator helps users  streamline the process of creating a README through their own terminal, and with the added utility of selecting licenses it aims to shortcut the sometimes arduous process of creating a README. Throgh making this project I learned quite a bit about Node and how to transfer data between script.
